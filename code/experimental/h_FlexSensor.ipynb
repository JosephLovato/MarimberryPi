    "Flex sensors are electrical devices that change their resistance based on how far they have been bent or flexed. Bending one way usually increases the resistance, and bending the other way decreases the resistance. You can learn more about flex sensors on [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex_sensor)."

    "According to the [datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/ForceFlex/FLEXSENSORREVA1.pdf) (can be found under the Documents tab of the [SparkFun website](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8606)), the flex sensors that come in our kits have a resistance range of over 60k Ohm to 110k Ohm. Our kits don't come with anything to measure resistance directly, but we can make use of a voltage divider to calculate it. You should remember this circuit from the photoresistor: there are 2 resistors in series between some voltage source, and the voltage between the resistors can be calculated using the voltage divider equation.\n",

We can also rearrange the voltage divider equation to find the resistance of the flex sensor as a function of the measured voltage.\n",

    "Because we need to use the ADC to measure the voltage from the flex sensor voltage divider, go to the [ADC notebook](h_ADC.ipynb) to run the code from it to test the flex sensor. You should modify the code to use the equation above to calculate the resistance when you test it. You should find the resistance range from roughly 60k Ohm to 110k Ohm. We've seen them go from over 100k Ohms to around 20k Ohms! These sensors are also rather imprecise and would require calibration to get an accurate measurement of force."

Double check your wiring with ADC notebook to make sure the connections are correct. Also double check your code for any bugs, and that you're using the same channel that the flex sensor is connected to.\n",

Make sure your voltage divider is connected to one of the channel pins of the ADC, and make sure your code is getting data from the same channel.\n",
